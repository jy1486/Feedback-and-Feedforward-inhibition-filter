# Feedback-and-Feedforward-inhibition-filter
Simulate visual processing of feedback or feedforward lateral inhibition which are commonly used in biological systems for edge detection. Normally examples are shown with one-dimensional data input such as machbands. This can also be done with 2D images by converting 2D images to matrices then solving the systems of linear equations. This can be used to visualize and explain optical illusions caused by lateral inhibition such as machbands and hermann grids.

feedforward.m - one dimensional input and output eg. machbands

TwoDimFeedForward.m - feedforward inhibition only but allows larger images

TwoDimFeedForward_Smallimages.m - outputs feedforward or feedback inhibition but only allows small images. eg. 50x 50

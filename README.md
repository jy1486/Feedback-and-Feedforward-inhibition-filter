# Feedback-and-Feedforward-inhibition-filter
Simulate visual processing of feedback and feedforward lateral inhibition which are commonly used in biological systems for edge detection. 

feedforward.m - one dimensional input and output eg. machbands

TwoDimFeedForward.m - feedforward inhibition only but allows larger images

TwoDimFeedForward_Smallimages.m - outputs feedforward and feedback inhibition but only allowed small images eg. 100 x 100
